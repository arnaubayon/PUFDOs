Bay√≥n, A., Valero, D. & Franca, M. 2023. Urban Flood Drifters (UFD): identification, classification and characterization.

This study examines floods of the past two decades years in order to identify the most common drifters mobilized by floods and their characteristics. The count and classification were conducted by reviewing available post-flood graphic material, such as press or social media, after the most widely covered events worldwide each year from 2000 to 2021.

- The directory "count", contains the files "count_floods_2000.csv", "count_floods_2001.csv"..., where we counted the prevalence of urban anthropogenic drifters on a yes/no basis in 250 pictures (8-10 pictures per event).

- The file "characteristics.csv" contains the relevant physical properties of more than 100 PUFDOs and the source of the information:

Lx:  crosswise length
Ly:  streamwise length
Lz:  total height
zc:  clearance height
m:   mass
V:   volume (bounding box)
rho: apparent density rho = m/V
Axy: area of front surface (exposed to flow)
